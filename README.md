# Algorithms Visualization

The main idea of this repo is to see a list of algorithms and how they works in an animated way.

## Dependencies

All the dependencies are included in the root of the project. This set of animations are built on top of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## Contributing

You can contribute in two main ways:

1. As a developer. In this case you can fork the repo, add your stuff and make a pull request.
2. Giving ideas about another algorithms.

## TODO

* Add the documentation of every algorithm or at least the basics
* Tune the routes of the `index.html` main file to match with the Github Page's routing way
